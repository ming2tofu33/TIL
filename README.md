# 📝 TIL (Today I Learned)

Welcome to my **TIL repository**!  
This repo is my personal learning journal, where I document what I study every day in **Python, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, SQL, and more**.  

The goal is to **learn consistently**, organize my knowledge, and track growth as a developer and data enthusiast. 🚀
